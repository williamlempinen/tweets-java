# Backend for my twitter clone [project](https://github.com/williamlempinen/tweets-web)

This is a quite quickly and poorly made backend for my twitter clone project. The main idea was to learn Springboot and MySQL. Currently no security features are implemented but will probably be added soon.
Server instance can be found from: `https://tweets-qmda.onrender.com/api/{endpoint}`.

Endpoints can be found from the code :D

Techonologies used in this project are Java, Springboot.

Frontend code can be found [here](https://github.com/williamlempinen/tweets-web)
